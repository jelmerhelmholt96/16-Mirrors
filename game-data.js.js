    phoenix: {
        name: "Phoenix",
        symbol: "üî•",
        element: "Fire",
        story: "I built something I really loved. Then I saw trouble coming. I thought if I just fought harder, I could save it. I was wrong. I lost everything. But something weird happened in that moment. Lying there in the mess, I felt this heat inside me, not the bad kind that destroyed everything, but something new being born. Losing wasn't my ending. It taught me how to start over. Now when I get that feeling, like I need to do something RIGHT NOW or everything will fall apart, I stop and check: Am I being brave, or am I just scared? I still mess up. I still rush in when I should wait. But I'm getting better at feeling the difference between real courage and just panicking. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When that feeling hits and you want to act immediately, are you protecting something that matters, or are you trying to not feel helpless?"
    },
    lion: {
        name: "Lion",
        symbol: "ü¶Å",
        element: "Fire",
        story: "Someone I cared about was being treated badly. I felt it in my chest, this roar building up. So I went in loud. I defended them hard. I was ready to fight anyone who disagreed. But here's the thing, my roaring scared the person I was trying to protect. They asked me to stop, and I didn't listen because I was so focused on being right. I thought protecting someone meant being the loudest voice in the room. Turns out, sometimes protection is quieter than that. It's asking 'what do you need?' instead of assuming I know. Now when I feel that roar building, I try to pause. Not because being loud is always wrong, sometimes people need someone to stand up for them. But because my job isn't to win the fight. It's to actually help. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you defend someone or something you care about, are you doing it for them, or because you need to feel strong?"
    },
    dragon: {
        name: "Dragon",
        symbol: "üêâ",
        element: "Fire",
        story: "I love building things. Ideas, projects, relationships, I get excited and throw all my fire into making something amazing. But one time I got so into creating this one thing that I didn't notice I was burning down everything else around it. My friendships. My rest. My balance. When I finally looked up, I'd built something impressive but I was standing alone in the ashes of everything I'd ignored. That's when I learned something hard: My fire can create AND destroy at the same time. The same energy that builds can burn. Now I have to check myself when I'm in building mode: What am I feeding this fire? And what am I accidentally burning while I'm not paying attention? I still love creating. That won't change. But I'm learning that real power isn't just about making big things. It's about knowing when to let the fire cool. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you're excited about something, what are you accidentally ignoring or burning while you focus on it?"
    },
    peacock: {
        name: "Peacock",
        symbol: "ü¶ö",
        element: "Fire",
        story: "When someone else succeeded, I couldn't just be happy for them. I immediately thought 'but what about me?' I needed to be the impressive one. Their shine felt like it dimmed mine. I kept my feathers spread, showing off constantly. But underneath, I was exhausted from performing. And I couldn't celebrate anyone without feeling like I was losing. I didn't realize that other people's light doesn't put out mine. There's room for all of us to shine. Now when I feel that comparison creeping in, I try to notice it: Am I actually less than I was before they succeeded? Or am I just scared of being overlooked? Sometimes I still need to be seen. That's okay. But I'm learning the difference between wanting recognition and needing it to feel real. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When someone else gets attention or success, does it feel like it takes something away from you?"
    },
    bear: {
        name: "Bear",
        symbol: "üêª",
        element: "Earth",
        story: "Everyone needed something from me. Help with this, support with that, be there for us. I said yes to everything because that's what good people do, right? Then winter came and my body just stopped. Not because I wanted it to. Because it had to. I had nothing left. Lying in my cave that first week, I felt guilty. All those people I was letting down. But slowly I realized, I wasn't letting anyone down. I was letting myself down by never resting. Now I protect my winter time. When I feel that emptiness creeping in, I stop before I collapse. Sometimes that means saying no. Sometimes it means disappearing for a bit. People don't always get it. They think I'm being cold. But I'm learning that if I don't rest, I won't have anything real to give. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When do you know you need to stop and rest? And what makes it hard to actually do it?"
    },
    turtle: {
        name: "Turtle",
        symbol: "üê¢",
        element: "Earth",
        story: "I used to think being slow meant I was doing something wrong. Everyone else seemed to move faster, finish sooner, get there quicker. I pushed myself to keep up. But I kept getting exhausted and lost. One day I just stopped trying to match their pace. I went my own speed. And something weird happened, I started actually arriving at places. Not first, but I got there. And I wasn't burned out when I did. The shell on my back isn't weighing me down. It's my home. It means I can take breaks without falling apart. I can move at my own pace because I'm carrying everything I need with me. Now when I see others racing ahead, I don't panic anymore. They're running their race. I'm walking mine. We might be heading to different places anyway. **Here's what I want to ask you:** What would change if you let yourself go at your own pace instead of trying to keep up with everyone else?"
    },
    elephant: {
        name: "Elephant",
        symbol: "üêò",
        element: "Earth",
        story: "I remember everything. Every hurt, every betrayal, every moment someone let me down. I carried all of it with me like stones in my pockets. I thought remembering meant I was protecting myself from getting hurt again. But those memories got so heavy that I couldn't move freely anymore. Every new person I met, I saw the old hurts. Every new situation, I expected the old patterns. One day someone pointed out that I wasn't actually protecting myself. I was just staying stuck in the past, living it over and over. So I started an experiment: What if I remembered but didn't hold onto it so tight? What if I could learn from what happened without letting it decide what happens next? Turns out my memory is a gift when I use it for wisdom instead of carrying old weight. Now I'm learning to remember without being trapped by what I remember. **Here's what I want to ask you:** What old hurt are you still carrying around? And what would it feel like to remember it without letting it control you?"
    },
    cat: {
        name: "Cat",
        symbol: "üê±",
        element: "Earth",
        story: "I kept redoing the same thing because it wasn't perfect. Everyone else finished and moved on. I was still stuck tweaking details that didn't matter. I thought being thorough meant being better. Really, I was just scared to be done and have it judged. I needed everything just right, under control. But perfectionism isn't about excellence, it's about fear. And controlling everything meant I couldn't let anyone help. I couldn't let anything be messy or uncertain. Then I realized something: cats always land on their feet not because we plan every landing, but because we trust ourselves to adjust. Perfection isn't about eliminating uncertainty. It's about trusting you can handle whatever comes. Now I'm learning that 'good enough' doesn't mean giving up, it means moving forward. **Here's what I want to ask you:** What would you do differently if you trusted yourself to handle imperfection?"
    },
    whale: {
        name: "Whale",
        symbol: "üêã",
        element: "Water",
        story: "I dove so deep into someone else's pain that I forgot which feelings were mine and which were theirs. They were struggling, so I absorbed it all. I felt their sadness, their fear, their loneliness. I thought that's what caring meant, feeling everything they felt. But I got lost down there. I couldn't tell where they ended and I began. When I finally surfaced, I was exhausted and they weren't any better. Turns out, drowning in someone else's ocean doesn't help them swim. Now I'm learning something new: I can dive deep and still know where the surface is. I can feel their depth without losing my own breath. I can care without carrying all of it for them. The ocean is vast enough to hold both their waves and mine. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you care about someone who's hurting, are you supporting them, or are you drowning in their pain with them?"
    },
    dolphin: {
        name: "Dolphin",
        symbol: "üê¨",
        element: "Water",
        story: "I made everyone laugh. I kept things light and fun because heavy feelings scared me. When things got serious, I'd crack a joke or change the subject. People loved being around me because I was always up for a good time. But one day a friend told me they couldn't talk to me about real stuff. They said I always deflected. That hurt. I thought I was helping by keeping things positive. But actually, I was just avoiding. Now I'm learning that real connection isn't just about the fun parts. Sometimes being there for someone means sitting with the hard stuff. Not fixing it or lightening it. Just being present. I still love to play. That's not fake. But I'm getting better at knowing when it's time to stop performing and just be real. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When things get heavy, do you stay present with it, or do you try to make it lighter so you don't have to feel it?"
    },
    octopus: {
        name: "Octopus",
        symbol: "üêô",
        element: "Water",
        story: "I'm really good at hiding. When I feel unsafe or exposed, I can change colors, shift shapes, blend into whatever's around me. People see what I want them to see. For a long time, I thought this was smart. Why show people your real self when they might use it against you? But hiding all the time gets exhausting. I started forgetting what my actual colors even were. I was so busy being what everyone else needed that the real me felt like a stranger. Now I'm trying something scary: letting people see me without the camouflage. Not everyone, I'm not reckless. But with people who've earned it. And it turns out that being seen is terrifying and freeing at the same time. I'm learning that I don't have to hide to be safe. Sometimes hiding is what makes me feel most alone. **Here's what I want to ask you:** What parts of yourself do you hide? And what would it feel like to let someone safe see the real you?"
    },
    chameleon: {
        name: "Chameleon",
        symbol: "ü¶é",
        element: "Water",
        story: "I became whoever they needed. Funny for this group, serious for that one, edgy here, sweet there. I thought being flexible meant being likable. I could read what people wanted and become it instantly. Then someone asked 'but what do YOU actually think?' and I realized I didn't know anymore. I'd disappeared into what everyone else wanted. My colors weren't mine, they were just reflections. I was so good at adapting that I adapted myself away. Now I'm learning something uncomfortable: not everyone will like the real me, and that has to be okay. Being liked for who you're pretending to be is lonelier than being yourself and having some people not get it. I still adapt, I still read rooms. But now I ask: Am I adjusting to connect, or am I disappearing to survive? **Here's what I want to ask you:** When do you change yourself to fit in? And how do you know if it's genuine flexibility or losing yourself?"
    },
    owl: {
        name: "Owl",
        symbol: "ü¶â",
        element: "Air",
        story: "I see everything clearly. While everyone else is stumbling around in the dark, confused and emotional, I can see exactly what's happening. I used to think this made me smarter than everyone else. I'd watch people make obvious mistakes and think 'why can't they just see what I see?' But then someone pointed out that I was so busy observing everything that I wasn't actually part of anything. I was watching life happen instead of living it. Turns out, seeing clearly and feeling things aren't opposites. I can understand what's happening AND care about it. I can be wise AND be involved. Now when I'm sitting up in my tree analyzing everything, I ask myself: Am I gaining wisdom or just avoiding being vulnerable? Sometimes the smartest thing I can do is stop watching and actually join in. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you're thinking about a situation, are you trying to understand it, or are you using thinking as a way to avoid feeling it?"
    },
    hawk: {
        name: "Hawk",
        symbol: "ü¶Ö",
        element: "Air",
        story: "From up high, I can see everything. I spot problems before they happen, see connections others miss, understand the bigger picture. I thought this meant I should point out what everyone else was doing wrong. After all, I could see it so clearly. But people started avoiding me. They said I was too critical, too harsh. I was confused, I was just telling the truth. Then someone explained: Being right doesn't give me permission to make people feel small. Seeing clearly doesn't mean I have to point out every flaw. Now I'm learning to use my vision differently. Instead of spotting what's wrong and announcing it, I ask: Is this mine to say? Will it actually help? Or am I just trying to prove I'm the smartest in the room? My sharp eyes are a gift, but only if I use them with care. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you see something clearly that others don't, do you share it to help, or to prove you're right?"
    },
    raven: {
        name: "Raven",
        symbol: "ü¶Ö",
        element: "Air",
        story: "I love puzzles. I love figuring things out, finding loopholes, outsmarting problems. My brain never stops running. But I got so into my own cleverness that I started playing games with people without realizing it. I'd say one thing but mean another. I'd test people to see if they could keep up with me. I thought I was being interesting. Really, I was being exhausting. People stopped trusting me because they never knew if I was being straight with them. That's when I learned: My intelligence is only valuable if I use it to connect, not to confuse. Now I try to be clear instead of clever. Direct instead of tricky. Turns out, real intelligence isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about using your mind to help people understand, not to prove you're one step ahead. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you're being clever or complex, are you trying to communicate clearly, or are you trying to seem smarter than you feel?"
    },
    butterfly: {
        name: "Butterfly",
        symbol: "ü¶ã",
        element: "Air",
        story: "People said I was doing well, but I felt like I was faking it. Like any moment they'd realize I didn't belong here. I achieved things but couldn't believe they were real. I kept waiting to be found out as the caterpillar I still felt like inside. My transformation was visible to everyone but me. They saw the wings, I still felt like I was crawling. I thought if they really knew me, they'd see I'm not as capable as I seem. But then someone asked: if you're faking it, how come it's working? Maybe the butterfly IS real, even if it remembers being a caterpillar. Now I'm learning that transformation isn't pretending, it's becoming. And feeling like an imposter doesn't mean you are one, it just means you grew faster than your self-image updated. **Here's what I want to ask you:** When you achieve something, can you believe it's real? Or do you wait for someone to take it away?"
